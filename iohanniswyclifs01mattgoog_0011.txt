INTRODUCTJON. IX

ln order that the Church may know and love the lise and con-
duct of Christ, it is the duty of theologians to learn and to teach
the Holy Scripture.¹

Wyclif insists frequently and strongly on the necessity of preaching
the Gospel to the people in their mother tongue. Some prelates‚ hc
says, do not know the Holy Scriptum, others conceal all that is said
in the Holy Scripture about the poverty of the clergy.

lt is of the greatest advantage for the Church that believers
should discern the meaning of Scriptum, and this can only be done
in the language which the people understand.2

Did not Christ and the apostles convert many people by preaching
in the vulgar tongue?

Why should not the modern disciples of Christ distribute the
same bread?

ln both languages then the saith should os Christ be taught to
the people. ³ With great vehemence he opposes the modern Pharisees
who contend that the Gospel must not be preached in the language
of the people: yet to do so is but to obey the Lord's command:
“Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to all mankind.’'
The reason why modern Pharisees neglect to preach the Gospel in
the popular language, is that they sear to betray how much their
own life contrasts with the Lord’s life.⁴

From this point of view Wyclif's English sermons are of especial
interest, for whilst his Latin sermons are always more or less tinged with
the language of the schools, his English ones are thoroughly popular
in style, and characterised by a downright simplicity and cordiality, in
many passages too by great depth of feeling, so that the madet, when
once he has overcome the obstacles of a somewhat difficult idiom,

INTR ODUCTION. XXI

Archbishop Courtenay's, issued at the end of May 1382, and in the
Archbishop’s license to the Carmelite Peter stokes at Oxford‚ complaint
is made of certain travelling preachers, who under the pretence of
gre'at sanctity (sub magne sanctitatis velamine), usurp the office of
preaching, and defend false, erroneou8‚ and heretical doctrines and
dogmas, in churches, in streets and in other places.

lt is now most severely prohibited that these doctrines, twenty-
four of which are expressly named, should henceforth be tolerated.¹

This, and similar prohibitions of the secular authorities‚² were
attended with but little success. The conviction of the necessity of
an internal reformation of the church was implanted by Wyclif's
disciples in the minds of all classes.

Their success may very probably have been mainly due to their
manner of life, which contrasted so strongly with that of the begging
friars and the other clergy; and is the majority of the poor preachers
answered to the life-like description which Chaucer gives in his
Canterbury tales of the good country clergyman, and which many
take to be a portrait of Wyclif ³ himself, the great success of the

country preachers may be easily explained.

Α good man was ther οι· religioun

And was a pore Pers-nun ot· a torm:

But riche he was of holy thought and werk.
He was also a lerned man. a clerk.

Thai Christos gospe! gladly wolde preche;
His parischens devomty wolde he teche.
Benigne he was, and wondur diligent,

And in adven-site sul pacient;

And such he was i-provcd oste sithes.

Ful loth were him to curse for his tythes
But rather wolde he ,γενεῇ ont of dom-te,
Unto his pore parisschens aboute.

Of his offrynge and eck of his substaunce.
He cowde in litel thing han suffisance.

Wyd was his parisch, and houses fer mondum
But he ne laste not for reyne ne thondur,

ln sicknesse ne in meschief to visite

The serrest in his parisschc, mochc and litu,
Upon his feet, and in his hond a stas.

This noble eusample unto his schccp he pas,
Thnt ferst he wroughte, and after that he taughte.

lt is true that none, or only a few, have now-a-days the power
:e perform miracles, and therefore we must choose another way, and
'pere-eive the mystical meaning of what is said of the performing of
miracles. Thus, the preat-her must heal the siclt, that is to say, free
sinners from their sins; he must raise the dead, that is, convert sinuers
hardened in crime: he must cleanse the lepers, that is, call upon the
proud to practise the grace of humility. And as sins are those setters
by which the demons are fastened to men. there can be no doubt,
that, if the preacher fulfils his duty in the first three points, the
demens too must give way. Such are the preacher's duties: From the
results it will be seen whether the preacher preaches rightly, and this
is of greater moment for believers than the fiction of Antichrist (the
l‘ope) that he has spiritual power over all others whilst he does
not prove by his deeds that he does spiritual good to anybody3
that he has the power to create or to change the sacraments; that
the lloly Scripture has neither authority nor validity except when
confirmed by him, or finally that he has the power to overthrow
:iny dogma.' More frequently and more earnestly than anything else,
must the preucher explain the Lord's Prayer to the people, for there
is no prayer which cun be more excellent. effectual and beneficial
sor every Cliristiun.² “Because God's word is not heard, and the field
ol* the Church is laid wuste” - exclaims Wyclif -— spiritual death
reigns everywhere.

languagcs; in Latin to the learned, and in the language of the country
to the uneducuted.³

¹ Et istud est melius fideli quam {iccio Antichristi (cod. pal. vindob. 3928 in
marg.: papa nota) qua sine auctoritate Dei vel testimonio cx parte populi fingit quod
habet potestatem spiritualem supra alios et non ostendit in opere quod spiritualis
beneficiencie quicquam facit, secundo quod hahet potestatem condendi et variandi
ecclesiastica sacramenta, ymmo quod scriptur-1 sacra non habet auctoritatem vel
efficaciam nisi de quanto is confirmaverit, ideo quemlibet articulum fidei poterit
reversare . . . . Sed veritas est quod nulla scriptura sacra propter auctorizacionem
vel canonizaeionem eorum est magis vel minus autentica . . . . ² Serm. Ι, 20. In
hoe evangelio debet predicator secundum formam rudem et congruam aptare populo
sensum oracionis dominice . . . . Nulla enim oracio est ista prestancior, efficacior et
unicuique suleli utilior. ³ (js. Buddensieg. Johann Wiclif und seine Zeit, pag. 168.

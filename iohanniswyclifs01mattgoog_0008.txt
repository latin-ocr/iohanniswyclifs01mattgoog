VI INTRODUCTION.

“It would therefore be far more comm'endable if Bishops would
preach and teach the catholic saith, instead of dispensing such things
as sacraments, or consecrating churches.’'¹

ln Opus Evangelicum (Ι, ¹3) Wyclif enumerates the occupations
to which an educated man devotesvhimself: “for the theologian there
is none nobler than preaching”.

b) What is to be preached, and who ts to preach to the
people.

To the people the Gospel must be preached, as God commands:
the truth must be proclaimed to them, even though they receive it
unwillingly.² Not comedies or tragedies‚ not fables or droll stories
must be told to the people, but simply and solely the law of the
Lord, as Christ and the Apostles delivered it; for in the law, that is
in the Gospel, is hidden the life which is able to quicken the

fidem catholicam quam quod ministraret hec sacramenta vel consecraret suas ecclesias.

5. The Edition

The following text is based on the Cambridge MS. as being the
most ancient and the most perfect of the five which hare been
described. The numerous errors which it contains could generally be
corrected from B and C. with regard to spelling, critical notet, and
commentary‚ 1 bave followed the principles which guided me in
editing De Ecclesia (see page 31).

lt only remains to proffer my hearty thanks to those who bave
helped me in this work.

My thanks are due in the first place to Mf· F. D. Matthew who
has once more supplied the English side-notes, and to whom 1 am
indebted for numerous critical observations.

1 desire also heartily to thank the respected Founder of our
Society. D‘· F. J. Furnivall, whose active help, especially in the
procuring of MSS„ has always been ready.

1 am also greatly obliged to the Librarian of Trinity College
Cambridge, D‘· R. Sinker, and to the Librarian of the Vienna Imperial
and Royal Library‚ Hert Hofrath von Bith, whose liberality enabled
me to use all the MSS l required, in the most convenient manner.

1 have also to thank the librarians of Czemowitz, Olmiltz and
Prague, for their kindness in procuring and sending me literary
assistance.

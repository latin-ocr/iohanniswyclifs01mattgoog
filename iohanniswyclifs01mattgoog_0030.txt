XX Vnt INTRODUCTION.

and of a third, that they date from the last years of Wyclif‘s life‚¹
and so too in our own day, it has been said that Wyclif's Latin sermons
belong to very different periods. With his notoriously high estimato
of the preacher's office, it can hardly be supposed that Wyclis first
began to compose sermons during the latter years of his Ιίἰε.2

Nevertheless‚ the majority os Wyclii's Latin sermons date from
this time, and it must be accepted as certain that it was only during
the last years of his life that he gave thern the form in which his
sermons have come down to us. Wyclif himself has, in the preface to
the first part, given us to understand this with unmistakeable clearness.
As it is the duty os every man, he says, to use the talent given by
God for that purpose for which it was bestowed upon him, so l
will employ the last days of my life, free from the cares of the
university twrofessorship, for the edification of believers, by collecting
together my “plain sermons” to the people.³ This statement carries
us to the later years of Wyclif's life. Closer indications of the date
are not to be found in the first part: but the more copious notices
contained in parts 2—4, enable us to fix it with tolerable accuracy.
These parts must therefore be considered at the present stage of our
enquiry. We will begin with the fourth part, as that contains the
greatest number of clues for a more exact determination of the date
of composition.

ln the very first sermon we find an exhortation to king Richard,
holding before him the example of his late father. ⁸ ln a considerable
number of passages there are allusions to the Schism, and more
definitely to the crusade against Clement Vll in the year 1383, which
was hcaded by Henry le Spenccr, Bishop of Norwich, the same who
had distinguished himself in the peasants’ rebellion by his courage
(“animositas’' — Walsingham sc.).

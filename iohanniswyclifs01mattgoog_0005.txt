a) On the importanceor the pit-testi& office.

Wyclif has given utterance very frequently to the high value
which he sets upon the Christian ministry. lt will suffice to mention
a few of these passages,

“The first and greatest work of the priest is the promulgation
of religious truth.”¹ “The proclamation of the gospel is the most
important pastoral duty.”2 “Of all a pastor’s dufles, there is none,
except the rectitude of his own life, which‘ should be more highly
esteemed than menching, for Christ has said: Blessed are those who
hear the word of God and keep it.'’ “But there is no doubt, that
the preaching of the word of God is to be valued equally highly
with the hearing of it.”³ “Far more precious than the administration
of the ecclesiastical sacraments is the preaching of the gospel; it is
a far more dignified office, than any worldly one.”⁴ As the soul

¹ Sermon, p. Π, 16: Primum atque precipuum opus pastoris est veritatis fidei
evangelizacio. ² ibid. Primum pastorale osticium debet csse agnorum Christi evan·
gelizacio. ³ De officio pastorali (cd. Lechler), p. 32: Hoc autem videtur fideliter
colligendum, quod inter omnia pastoris officia post vite iusticiam est sancta predi-
cacio plus laudanda ..... Nec dubium quin verbi Dei predicacio sit tanta sicut
audicio. ⁴ Opus Evang. 11, 35: Evangelizacio talis verbi est preciosior quam
ministr-acio alicuius ecclesiastici sacramenti curati . . . . ib. 1, 31; Christus enim
cognovit quod evangelizacio est dignius ministerium pro acquirenda beatitudine quam
quecunque temporalium dominacio . . . .

X INTRODUCTION.

cannot fail to be impressed by their simple beauty.¹ “ln the English
sermons’', says Lechler, “we find more frequently a plain and popular,
even a drastic style of speaking, and a moving heartfelt tone, especially
when the preacher anticipates the judgment-seat and the last account.” ²

In the office of preaching, the priest should not be hindered.
The preacher must be free. One thoughtful and outspoken discourse
does far more good to the church than any number of friars'
sermons by which the Lord’s word is only depraved.³ But these
monks, Wyclif complains, obstruet such preaching. This complaint,
that the pulpit is not free, that the full exercise of the ministry is
prohibited‚ is reiterated in several of his works.⁴ Unfit men aspire to
the higher osfices of the Church, and prevent the Lord’s word from
being prcached to the people‚ whilst those who strive to preach it
are persecuted as heretics. ⁵ The pseudo-friars — we read in another
passage —- give out that preaching is forbidden to priests unless
they have a special license for it from the bishop or Pope, for (as
they falsely contend) all other apostles received such a permission
from Saint Peter. But this is not true. Every deacon and priest had
the right to preach‚ and so accordingly Paul used to preach, long
before he had seen St. Peter.⁶ Every priest should give himself
continually to this work: if he does not do so, he should devote
himself to a worldly occupation.'¹ The bishop too should attend to
this office, for a substitute would be as much out of place as at the
Last Judgment‚ where everyone must answer for himself.⁸

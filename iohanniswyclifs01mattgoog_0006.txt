from anj- bodl-13·- suffering.”¹ “Amongst all the works of Christian
:hain-z says u'yclif quoting Robert Grosteste‚ Bishop of Lincoln,
mne is nobler, better, and more to be desired than preaching.’‘²
A whole chapter of his work De Officio pastorali (ll, 2) is devoted
to this subject.³ The value of preaching, he there says, is evident
from Christ having ordered his apostles before His ascension to
pren-:h the gospel to 211 mankind. Surely the wisest of all teachers
would not have done so, were not the sermon the most laudable of
all the works of an apostle or a curate.⁴ “That preaching is the
:ucat important work of such men, may be seen also by its success,
:3:ae Christ erfected more byvthe proclamation of the Gospel by means
of tiae Apostles, than by all the miracles that He performed Himself
En Iasae-:⁵ Therefore St. Angustiae rightly reminds us, that the
:vermina εἴη so short a time of the immense world of heathenisrm
ἐἶτ such simple persons as the Apostles, is a greater miracle of Christ's
‘jan an]- other which He performed since his lncarnation.⁸

And since, according to the Apostle Paul, it is Christ Himself who
speaks {n the pre2cher, it follows that the praise belongs not to the
pruche, who is the medium, but to Jesus Christ Himself in the preacher.

12‘ it be Christ Himself who creares spiritual children by means
οἱ such sermons, a matter which is infinitely higher than any natural
generalem, it is evident, that God's omnipotente manifests itself in
the sermon more than in any other of His works.

havenly kingdom even now on earth.⁷
